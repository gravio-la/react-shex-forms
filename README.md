# @gravio.la/react-shex-forms

A Forms generation framework based on React that takes a [Shex Shape](https://shex.io/shex-semantics/index.html#shexr) as an input and generates a
form based on a certain renderer. Shapes can be derived directly from the subtree of the provided shape or references via IRI. This can possibly and by design
lead to recursive schemata.
